solution 1007 :

based on Euler totient function.
here dp[i] represents number of relative primes of ith number
first mark all prime numbers, now for each number 
if 'i' is a prime number: dp[i] = i-1 (one can think)
if its not,
   find the smallest factor, consider it to be some k.
	and i = k *(i/k) 
	if i/k % k  == 0
    	dp[i] = dp[i/k]*k
	else
		dp[i] = dp[i/k]*(k-1) 

	(just think how can we got above 2 equations)

solution 1020 :

A simple problem based on number theory,if Alice takes first :

game would be like : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
					 L W W L W W L W W

if bob takes first : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
					 W W L W W L W W L

W - stands for winning , L stands for loosing and number represents 
number of marbles present.
